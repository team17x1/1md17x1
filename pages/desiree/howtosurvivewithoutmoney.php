<p class="byline">October 8th</p>
                <p>
                    A common misassumption about travelling, is that it requires you to have a ton of money. But really, a ton of money is a "nice-to-have", definitely not a "need-to-have". Here’s a few tricks on how to go about it, without spending your entire savings account. </p>

                <h2 class="margintop100">Got no money? No problem</h2>

                <div class="container">

                    <div class="title1"><span><img src="images/arrow.svg" alt="Expand text" class="expandimg">  Get a job!</span>

                    </div>
                    <div class="content1">
                        <p>

                            Just like you would search for a job in your home country, you apply for job openings in the country you’re in now. Many places get busier during holidays for example, so you could have a good chance of landing a job even if you’re only planning on staying a few months.</p>

                        <p>

                            (Of course, technically to be able to do this, you must have a work permission and all the right kind of paperwork… So of course, I have never done this myself, just for the record :) )


                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>



                <div class="container">

                    <div class="title2"><span><img src="images/arrow.svg" alt="Expand text" class="expandimg"> Do a workaway!</span>

                            Workaway.org is a worldwide platform to connect with other people – it is for hosts, who are searching for volunteer workers, and volunteers who are looking for a place to work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So basically, it is a platform for job openings in all parts of the world. But the perks of this is, that you get around all the hassle of paperwork, since you will not get paid. Instead the host provides accommodation for you, and sometimes food expenses are covered as well.

                            Staying at someone’s house for free + having a local tour guide to show you all the cool things to do + a potential new friend. What have you got to lose?

                        <p>

                            Often you can get a cleaning job or reception hours to get free or at least a cheaper rent. If not – you still save a bunch compared to staying at a hotel. Also, you’re bound to meet a lot of interesting people in a hostel.

                        </p>
                    </div>

                            It is super helpful to have local friends who’re already established when coming to a new city. Something that would make a huge difference for you as a newcomer, might be the smallest insignificant thing to do for someone else.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let’s say maybe you have to pay a whole lot for a metro pass to get to work in your new city… But hey – you discover that your new neighbor works in the same area as you, and he’s got a car. So just go ask the guy if you could do carpooling in the morning. Who knows, maybe he would benefit from it too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course you shouldn’t exploit people, but take the time to get to know the people around you. For all that I know, I bet you also have some qualities or skills that could be useful for them.
                        </p>

                            Go for the low-fare tickets, when picking your next destination. If you’re a ‘go-with-the-flow’ kind of person, and you haven’t got a set plan for when to go where, you can get low-fare tickets for practically nothing. It can be a surprisingly cheap option. And you might end up going to a destination you would never have thought of, if you hadn’t been browsing for the cheapest tickets avaliable to anywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (A few months ago, I found a bus-ticket from Milan to Switzerland for as little as 3€. I hadn’t planned on going to the Swiss side of the Alps, but I figured, for that price – why not, right?)

                    <div class="title7"><span><img src="images/arrow.svg" alt="Expand text" class="expandimg">  Hitch hike between your destinations</span>

                    <div class="content7">
                        <p>

                            This is by far the cheapest way of getting around. It can be very time consuming though, and you just can’t know when you’ll arrive. So make sure you have time enough if you’re going with this option. But the effort is worth it – you’ll get from A to B without spending anything + you might meet some really cool people on the way.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Alternatively check out the different ridesharing platforms such as <a href="https://www.blablacar.com/" target="_blank">www.blablacar.com</a> (New window). This is a site where you can search for rides on your desired route, and it’ll give you a price determined by the driver.

                            Another handy trick to save money on flight tickets, is to pay in the airline’s local currency.
