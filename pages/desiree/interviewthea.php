                <p><strong>- So, two years ago, you went to India to get certified as a yoga teacher. Tell us about that...</strong></p>

                <div class="column">

                    <p>I decided to go to India because I wanted to try something completely new. I've always traveled a lot, to amazing places, but it has always been within my comfort zone. </p>
                    <p>


                        I chose India because it's where yoga origins, and I wanted to be taught by people who has yoga running in their blood. At the same time it took me out there, where everything was new and scary.</p>

                <p><strong>- And now you live in Costa Rica. How did you get from India to where you are now?
</strong></p>

                <div class="column">

                    <p>After my trip to India, I knew I wanted to combine my new profession with another passion of mine &mdash; surfing. Shortly after I finished my training in India, I got a job in Sri Lanka.

                    </p>

                    <p>So I was now heading to a place, where the temperature of the water is like a hot shower, and a rice &amp; curry is as cheap as you could imagine. Here I lived for about 6 months, and I absolutely loved it.
                    </p>

                    <p>After Sri Lanka, I went back to Europe. I got a job at a surf camp in southern Portugal where I taught yoga, made breakfast for the guests and drank a lot of Sangria. I am now in Costa Rica, to once again try something completely different &mdash; hopefully learn a bit of Spanish &mdash; and feel the culture.</p>

                <p><strong>- What is your best memory from the last two years?</strong></p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>I have so many amazing memories from my travels. Memories which have made me stronger, memories which make me laugh and memories that just can't be justified with words.</p>
                    <p>I can't choose one specific one &mdash; it's more a feeling I've gotten a lot through my work and travels. After every yoga class I teach, I look everyone individually in the eyes to kinda say thank you, but without words. It's such a strong moment. People give you the biggest smiles, coming all the way from their hearts, some people have a tear falling down their cheek and some are just completely still. In this situation everyone is very vulnerable, and often very soft in their looks.</p>



                    <p>This moment after a yoga class is one of the best feelings in the world. And I would never have been able to experience this, without my first travel to India. </p>

                <p><strong>- And what about the tough situations, have you ever been somewhere thinking "Damn, I’m screwed"?</strong></p>

<section>
                <div class="column">

                    <p>I have been in a lot of situations like that... Especially because I am very unorganized and like to do my travels as they come. Luckily I'm very easy-going and I always see the positive side of every situation.</p>

                    <p>So one time I woke up after being asleep in a bus 6 hours straight (jetlag...) and realized it had gone in the wrong direction. I was now in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, on the country side in Sri Lanka. I ended up having to take an expensive taxi home, because I had a class to teach the following morning. Right there, I kinda thought “damn….” But hey, it's always a funny story afterwards :)</p>

                <p><strong>- Any advice to someone who has dreams of going on an adventure like yours?</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Just simply do it! Book a ticket and get out there. See, eat, feel, explore and touch the world, because you then soon realize how universal a smile is, and how amazing food taste, when you share it with friends you've just met.</p>
